## about me

Sinisa Sokolic, Chief Technology Officer and Member of the Board, RIS AG

Born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in 1978, I began my professional journey as a trained IT specialist for system integration. After spending nearly a decade in the public sector, I transitioned into IT consulting, where I guided the strategic direction of medium-sized and large enterprises through various mandates.

Since 2010, I have led consulting and software development at RIS AG, where I serve as Chief Technology Officer and Member of the Board. In my role as a product owner, I play a pivotal part in shaping the companyâ€™s direction and the evolution of its products.

I am also a regular speaker at international conferences, sharing insights on technology and industry trends.

Outside of my professional life, I am passionate about running, crossfit and golf. When time permits, I enjoy producing electronic music and exploring my interest in photography.
